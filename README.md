# Novixx's Universe Simulation

This is a (currently simple) text-based universe simulation. Written in pure Python, it aims to simulate a random universe realistically.

Currently it only supports the Big Bang theory, but may support other theories in the future.

## Features

Currently, the simulation is in a very early stage and not yet to be used for anything useful, but I aim to make it useful for research and educational purposes.

## Installation

To install the simulation, you can simply clone the repository and run the simulation with Python 3.9 or higher.
